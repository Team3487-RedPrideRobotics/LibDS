# LibDS Rewrite :robot:
Do you want to use a RoboRIO outside of FRC? Do you want to avoid a part of the crippling price-tag of proprietary software?
We are trying to solve both of these! One of our projects, the Quaker Imagineering Robotic Assistant (QIRA) needs software just like this!

We will try to maintain this software as often as possible, but we are a FRC oriented team, so our scheduling is based around the season.

Any help would be greatly appreciated!

### Warning!
Since QIRA is the primary purpose for this project, her needs will be satisfied first. :japanese_ogre:

## What Can I Use This For?
:heavy_check_mark: Controlling a RoboRIO without NI software.

:x: Not for FRC events! FRC does not support this project.

## Why Rewrite
The goal of this repository is to improve upon the original LibDS created by Alex Spataru & Boomaa23.
I would have had fun using the original repository, but I acutally had issues with Qt and Cmake, so I
wanted to make an easier to implement project.
